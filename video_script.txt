2-MINUTE VIDEO SCRIPT — TOTLE FRONTEND ROUND 1 (TopicSearch) - UPDATED

Hello, I'm Namitha.
I built TopicSearch using Vite + React and enhanced UX with Framer Motion animations.

Key points:
- Real-time, case-insensitive search
- Staggered card entrance for better visual hierarchy
- Hover + tap animations on cards
- Modal opens with a spring scale animation

Run: npm install && npm run dev
